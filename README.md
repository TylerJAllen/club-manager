# Recipes

## Created by Tyler Allen
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.


## User Story

* As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all team or club members.
* As a user, I'd like to click a team or club member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, which should include more details about them.
* As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do.
* As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
* As an administrator, I want to add new users to the club. (User authentication is not required).
* As an administrator, I want to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
* As an administrator, need the option to delete a user, in case they leave the club or team.
